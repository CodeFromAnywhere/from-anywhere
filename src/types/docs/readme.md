# Typenet

Welcome to **Typenet**

Typenet is a standard for datastuctures for database models.

I am creating this as an attempt to create a single standard that will make it possible to integrate decentralised data systems in web 4.0

If everyone stores their data in the same datastructures, it becomes possible to integrate with each other!

Let's do this.
