Since I was in a huuuuge flow, I decided to do this refactor now.. I guess I gotta use my productivity.

<!-- moet nog ff door al begin ik moet te raken... moet morgen avond passionfruit afhebben, en het is nog maar de vraag of dit wel lukt -->

TODO:

- ‚úÖ put `OperationConfig` and `OperationIndex` inside of the `operation` key
- ‚úÖ to ensure you can still write the description in a markdown file, but also edit it in the `PackageJson` form, add key `operation.description` but also state that, if available, will be taken indexed from `OPERATION.md`
- ‚úÖ all keys in `OperationIndex` should be renamed to `xyzIndexed` and this should become a new convention in the form (hide those)
- ‚úÖ document the `xyzCalculated` and `xyzIndexed` conventions somewhere, and everything else too
- ‚úÖ rename `PackageJson` -> `Operation`
- ‚úÖ remove `SensibleConfig` -> `Operation["operation"]`
- ‚úÖ remove `ProjectType` -> `OperationClassification`
- ‚úÖ remove `sensible` word anywhere, and their packages.
- ‚úÖ remove `operation-ui` from repo
- ‚úÖ remove `OperationConfig` -> `Operation["operation"]`

Pffff.... Started this morning now we're here 5pm... Enormous refactor :P

- ‚úÖ remove `OperationIndex` -> `Operation["operation"]`
- ‚úÖ remove `Peer` -> `Person`
- ‚úÖ check all operations build by running all of them and checking it, fast.
- ‚úÖ finalize `PackageJson` -> `Operation` (case sensitive)
- ‚úÖ fix `api-types`
- ‚úÖ fix `function-server-endpoints`
- ‚úÖ fix `server-login`
- ‚úÖ run `runScriptEverywhere build` again, now hopefully with very few errors

# Finish PackageJson refactor

Omg it's going soooo fast! Internet is such a time robber! So good that I got my internet turned off today most of the day.

- ‚úÖ put `PackageJson`, `OperationIndex` and `OperationConfig` into a migration typescript script (get from backup).
- ‚úÖ migrate all of those into `package.json` to apply new `Operation` model. Use `readJsonFile`, `readMarkdownFile` and `writeJsonFile` instead of `db.udpate`. First write to `assets` to check if it works well.
- ‚ùå Feeling so fed up with this, so stopped and started with something else

# search-web-ui

‚úÖ We need to search! For fun, I started with a search homepage for the OS. I also tried to create a tik-tok-kinda layout :) very fun.

# Other

‚úÖ Made a very cool function `mergeNestedObject` that can merge a recursively partial object into an existing object in a typesafe way!!!!

üëÅ **Revelation**: whow, ESM has much better typescript import autocomplete. Maybe should switch to it completely.

üí° **Idea:** when running yarn build, ts server should be restarted programmatically, if possible, or refetch from the data there, it's no rocket science, but it just doesn't watch now

# Fix things...

Ok last stretch... I can be done before noon! Let's try.

- ‚úÖ `fs-orm` doesn't work anymore, debug safely with tests from `database`
- ‚úÖ after it's fixed, run migration successfully (new package.json's)
- ‚úÖ migrate operation classification too
- ‚úÖ confirm that `rebuildOperation` still works fine
- ‚úÖ go over, refactor and rebuild everything with `classification` in the file (32 files)
- ‚úÖ fix `mergeNestedObject`
- ‚úÖ fix skip problem, temporary fix for memory leak, then run `rebuildAllOperations`
- ‚úÖ improve `getOperationClassification`
- ‚úÖ re-index `OperationClassification` for all operations
- ‚úÖ remove `hasGeneratedImports`
- ‚úÖ `rebuildOperation function-util` and confirm `hasGeneratedDependenciesIndexed` is true
- ‚úÖ add `import type` to some stuff
- ‚úÖ test if `generateSdkOperations true` works and has no errors.
- ‚úÖ Then `generateSdkOperations`
- ‚úÖ figure out if `api-types` can now be built with the new sdks (previously circular dependency caused by `api-types.RealApiReturnType`, might be fixed with the diff of `hasGeneratedDependenciesIndexed`, `hasGeneratedImportsIndexed`? Test it. ‚ùå **It's still not solved, but at least now I have completed the whole refactor. Circular dependency is not a huge problem for now... Can be solved later, but for this I really need to look at this very well, maybe I should create some tooling in order to see where the circle happens. Maybe it already exists? Seems a common problem**

# Naming refactor

- ‚úÖ Remove my name anywhere, I'm going to be anonymously hidden in the background. **My name doesn't occur much, except for on the site. That's all Jan wilmake now. Most important is that I'm going to build my network on this pseudonym from now on. And maybe more fake personas in the future. Wijnand should be disconnected from the online world, so I'm not easy to find**
- ‚ùå Remove the 'King', it's just 'OS'. _It's cleaner_. ;) **For now this seems unimportant since it isn't deployed yet. Make sure I don't mention King OS anywhere in the docs, ask others if they see it anywhere.**

# API refactor & auth layer functional

Goal: Finish the API refactor, finish that neatly, and document it well. It will make the auth layer possible. If I still have speed by then, also finish the auth layer. It's a requirement for almost anything...

- ‚úÖ confirm every node function is added into `sdk-api`, including the ones with the previous convention `PostApi`/`GetApi`
- ‚úÖ They don't seem to be there, they also seem to be missing in the `sdk-api-keys`. Fix this
- ‚úÖ problem is they are marked as `node-server` operations. Ensure its only a node-server if you set this in operationConfig.
- ‚úÖ clean up sdk generation a lot and add sdk for UI
- ‚úÖ Getting errors for `sdk-ui`. fix them: https://github.com/quadristan/ts-indirect-type-reference-bug ... Solution seems to add types...
- ‚úÖ is "getApiKeys" and "postApiKeys" in use? do I need it after? Remove if not.
- ‚úÖ confirm the API includes all as functions. Is there any harm to also add the cjs + esm stuff? Probably only possible if it's indexed properly. UI is not possible. I mean, maybe, but that would be strange.
- ‚úÖ remove `postEndpoints` and `getEndpoints` from `runFunctionServer`. The root should be very clean now, no undocumented functions.
- ‚úÖ go over `executeFunctionWithParameters` and check if function naming conventions are applied there as well.
- ‚úÖ remove old stuff with `xyzPostApi` and `xyzGetApi`
- ‚úÖ disable new auth for now, add old auth-layer back so I can continue with passionfruit

‚úÖ üåê share donelist [](/Users/king/King/operations/tools/types/code-types/todo/done/2022-11-12-refactor.md) with team

‚úÖ Tell @Bhagya his code don't work still. I still get his error because he didn't export his types.

‚úÖ Confirm API works well and I can login on any ui. May need to add some frontend for it...
