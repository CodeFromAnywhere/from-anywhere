# `from-anywhere`: The Code From Anywhere Toolbelt

This repo contains useful utilities for JS, TS, React, Node, Bun, Next, and more, to be used as a shared codebase for CFA projects.

To explore the code, please clone or visit [the github codespace](https://github.dev/CodeFromAnywhere/from-anywhere)

## Ideas

Later, `from-anywhere` could be a great example of a local OpenAPI. Maybe I can adapt the OpenAPI standard to also include code from files and create a server for that too. This way I can use the same AI search for local functions as well. It's a bit more work, but could be very fruitful. ðŸš€ Main thing that would be needed would be the ability to dynamic-import functions locally to be able to run them locally in the browser. This way, we can set up a nice next-project too which hosts that. Needs more thought though...
